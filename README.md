# Ford-Gobike-data-EDA
extracting user insights of the dataset to help decision makers 

Introduction :
In this data set I'm doing exploratory and explanatory data analysis
I'm asking alot of questions like :
which days are our peak ride dayes ?
which customer gender we have most ?
do we have subscribers more or customers ?


Limitations :
There were about 8000 null values in the data , I choosed to delete them
there were many more outliers but I kept them due to the EDA purpose

Summary :
Males are our niche customers
Females tend to last longer in every trip
customers tend to last longer in every trip
subscribers trips counts are high by far
